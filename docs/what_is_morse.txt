ðŸ“– What is Morse Code?

Morse code is a system of communication that uses a series of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals) to represent letters, numbers, and symbols.  

It was invented in the 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail and became widely used in telegraphy. Morse code enabled people to send messages across great distances almost instantly â€” long before telephones or the internet existed.

âœ… Fun fact:
Even today, Morse code is still used in aviation, amateur radio, and as a fun way to encode secret messages!
